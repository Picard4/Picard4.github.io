                <h1>Javascript and OOP</h1>
                <p>I really enjoy programming so far in Computer Science, and the next steps that I will be taking to
                    improve are learning about Javascript and Object Oriented Programming. I look forward to learning
                    nearly everything that we learn in Computer Science, and my favourite
                    courses so far suggest that I should aim for a programming job. By learning to code in Javascript
                    and fully take advantage of objects, I can make programs that far
                    exceed what I can do with my current skill set.</p>

                <h1>Intermediate Game Development</h1>
                <p>When developing RNG Hell, I tried to keep my scope for the game as small as possible and instead
                    provide an experience that isn't commonly seen in games. The reason for this small scope was because
                    I still have a long way to go before I can work on a
                    fully realized video game. In due time, I particularily hope to learn about setting up movement,
                    proper AI and integration with
                    original assets. In order to accomplish this, I believe that I need to become well-versed in video
                    game engines to
                    take my first steps in professional game development.</p>

                <h1>Complex Mathematics and Programming</h1>
                <p>I've always loved Math growing up, and that still hasn't changed today as I'm currently taking a
                    complimentary Science Calculus 1 course. So far the complex math that I'm used to working with in a
                    traditional math class hasn't been
                    applied much in Computer Science, but I know that those skills will be important later on. I'm
                    looking forward to apply more of my math skills to Computer Science, as I would really like a job
                    that incorporates both programming and math.</p>

                <h1>Designing for Multiple Systems</h1>
                <p>When it comes to collecting video games, I often enjoy buying multiple different versions of the same
                    game to compare the differences. On top of that, one of my favourite consoles of all time is the
                    Nintendo Wii U, a device that is
                    infamous for its lack of third party support. Due to the way I like to enjoy my video games, I've
                    always been curious about the needs of different
                    platforms when running the same program. Currently I've only learned about developing for PC, with
                    the exception of web development, so in
                    time I hope to learn what makes certain machines more or less desirable for developers when compared
                    to the common customer.</p>
