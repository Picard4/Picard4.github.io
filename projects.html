                <h2>RNG Hell</h2>

                <h3>Fall 2019</h3>

                <p>
                    The original RNG Hell was the first video game I ever developed, with it being used as the final
                    project of my Programming I course at John Abbott College, which was taught by Larry Fagen.
                    When developing this first project, I tried to keep my scope for the game as small as possible and
                    instead
                    provide an experience that isn't commonly seen in games in order to produce something unique without
                    having to implement mechanics which were out of my reach at the time. After coming up with multiple
                    mold-breaking
                    ideas, I wound up creating a game that is highly dependent on luck, with most deaths being caused by
                    random instant kills. For good measure, I even implemented a feature which can delete the
                    player's score if they happen to be unlucky, which can trigger even during what would otherwise be
                    successful runs! Needless
                    to say this is not a game that is meant to be taken seriously, unless you have a gambling addiction
                    and an interest in destroying your computer.

                <h2>RNG Hell Online</h2>

                <h3>Fall 2020</h3>

                <p>
                    This sequel to the original RNG Hell was developed as the final project for my Web Programming I
                    course, which was taught by Helen Katalifos. For this second attempt, I aimed to showcase how much I
                    had improved over the past year by developing a new RNG Hell game which completely surpassed the
                    original, while still retaining the frantic gameplay that is endemic to the franchise. This was
                    accomplished through the introduction of multiple new features, such as two new
                    attacks, the ability to fire melee attacks in 4 different directions, a new luck stat
                    which reduces the odds of randomly getting instantly killed (along with the chances of having one's
                    score deleted), and an all-new Online mode. This Online
                    mode features the "latest and greatest" netcode, which will frequently slow down gameplay, allow
                    enemies to occasionally "rollback" to life, and randomly disconnect; prematurely ending the player's
                    game without a score to show for it, all without requiring an actual internet connection!

                <h1>Steel Hostilities</h1>
                <h2>Fall 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    Steel Hostilities is a Sports/Fighting game that is heavily inspired by the <a class="inline-link"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!">Punch-Out!!</a> series which
                    tasks
                    players to defeat three bosses as a warrior armed with light punches, heavy sword slashes, the
                    ability to dodge horizontally, and two super
                    moves which can quickly turn the tide of battle. The campaign does not end upon the defeat of the
                    final boss, as skilled fighters can endlessly rechallenge stronger versions of all three
                    opponents in pursuit of a high score. Should a combatant find themself exhausted of constantly
                    having to fight, Steel Hostilities includes an automatic "quick-save" feature which will allow the
                    contender
                    to take a break and return to their most recent fight, though this can only be done once per bout to
                    prevent save scumming.
                    The game was developed by <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/RyanBujold">Ryan
                        Bujold</a> and I as the
                    final project for a Game Programming course at John Abbott College,
                    which was taught by <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/VikramSinghMTL">Vikram
                        Singh</a>.
