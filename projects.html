                <h1>Steel Hostilities</h1>
                <h2>Fall 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    Steel Hostilities is a Sports/Fighting game that is heavily inspired by the <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!">Punch-Out!!</a> series which
                    tasks
                    players to defeat three bosses as a warrior armed with light punches, heavy sword slashes, the ability to dodge horizontally, and two super
                    moves which can quickly turn the tide of battle. The campaign does not end upon the defeat of the
                    final boss, as skilled fighters can endlessly rechallenge stronger versions of all three
                    opponents in pursuit of a high score. Should a combatant find themself exhausted of constantly
                    having to fight, Steel Hostilities includes an automatic "quick-save" feature which will allow the contender
                    to take a break and return to their most recent fight, though this can only be done once per bout to
                    prevent save scumming.
                    The game was developed by <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/RyanBujold">Ryan
                        Bujold</a> and I as the
                    final project for a Game Programming course at John Abbott College,
                    which was taught by <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/VikramSinghMTL">Vikram Singh</a>
                    in the Fall of
                    2021.

                <h1>Intermediate Game Development</h1>
                <p>When developing RNG Hell, I tried to keep my scope for the game as small as possible and instead
                    provide an experience that isn't commonly seen in games. The reason for this small scope was because
                    I still have a long way to go before I can work on a
                    fully realized video game. In due time, I particularily hope to learn about setting up movement,
                    proper AI and integration with
                    original assets. In order to accomplish this, I believe that I need to become well-versed in video
                    game engines to
                    take my first steps in professional game development.</p>

                <h1>Complex Mathematics and Programming</h1>
                <p>I've always loved Math growing up, and that still hasn't changed today as I'm currently taking a
                    complimentary Science Calculus 1 course. So far the complex math that I'm used to working with in a
                    traditional math class hasn't been
                    applied much in Computer Science, but I know that those skills will be important later on. I'm
                    looking forward to apply more of my math skills to Computer Science, as I would really like a job
                    that incorporates both programming and math.</p>

                <h1>Designing for Multiple Systems</h1>
                <p>When it comes to collecting video games, I often enjoy buying multiple different versions of the same
                    game to compare the differences. On top of that, one of my favourite consoles of all time is the
                    Nintendo Wii U, a device that is
                    infamous for its lack of third party support. Due to the way I like to enjoy my video games, I've
                    always been curious about the needs of different
                    platforms when running the same program. Currently I've only learned about developing for PC, with
                    the exception of web development, so in
                    time I hope to learn what makes certain machines more or less desirable for developers when compared
                    to the common customer.</p>
