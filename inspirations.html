                <h1>Javascript and OOP</h1>
                <p>I really enjoy programming so far in Computer Science, and the next steps that I will be taking to improve are learning about Javascript and Object Oriented Programming. </p>
                <p>I look forward to learning nearly everything that we learn in Computer Science, and my favourite courses so far suggest that I should aim for a programming job.</p>
                <p>By learning to code in Javascript and fully take advantage of objects, I can make programs that far exceed what I can do with my current skill set.</p>

                <h1>Intermediate Game Development</h1>
                <p>When developing RNG Hell, I tried to keep my scope for the game as small as possible and instead provide an experience that isn't commonly seen in games.</p>
                <p>The reason for this small scope was because I still have a long way to go before I can work on a fully realized video game.</p>
                <p>In due time, I particularily hope to learn about setting up movement, proper AI and integration with original assets.</p>
                <p>In order to accomplish this, I believe that I need to become well-versed in video game engines to take my first steps in professional game development.</p>

                <h1>Complex Mathematics and Programming</h1>
                <p>I've always grown up loving Math, and that still hasn't changed today as I'm currently taking a complimentary Science Calculus I course</p>
                <p>So far, the complex math that I'm used to working with in a traditional math class hasn't been applied much in Computer Science, but I know that those skills will be important later on.</p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to apply more of my math skills to Computer Science, as I would really like a job that incorporates both programming and math.</p>

                <h1>Designing for Multiple Systems</h1>
                <p>When it comes to collecting video games, I often enjoy buying multiple different versions of the same game to compare the differences.</p>
                <p>On top of that, one of my favourite consoles of all time is the Nintendo Wii U, a device that is infamous for its lack of third party support.</p>
                <p>Due to the way I like to enjoy my video games, I've always been curious about the needs of different platforms when running the same program.</p>
                <p>Currently I've only learned about developing for PC, with the exception of web development, so in time I hope to learn what makes certain machines more or less desirable for developers when compared to the common customer.</p>
